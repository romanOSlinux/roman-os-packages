# CHANGELOG — roman-os-calamares-config

> Calamares graphical installer configuration. Custom Python modules: `roman-os_before`, `roman-os_bootloader`, `roman-os_displaymanager`, `roman-os_final`, `roman-os_kernel`, `roman-os_packages`, `roman-os_remove_nvidia`, `roman-os_ucode`.

## 2026.06.26

### Default shell for the installed user: bash → fish
- **`etc/calamares/modules/users.conf`** line 33: `user.shell` changed from `/bin/bash` to
  `/bin/fish`. Calamares' standard `users` module passes this to `useradd -s`, so the human
  user created during install gets fish as their login shell.
- **Why:** make fish roman-os's default interactive shell out of the box. `roman-os-fish-config` ships
  the matching `config.fish` into `/etc/skel/.config/fish/` and `depends=('fish')`, so config +
  binary are guaranteed present — full parity with the bash/zsh setup, no regression.
  `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` stay in skel so `tobash`/`tozsh` revert in one command. Root stays on bash.
- The `roman-os_final` route (`chsh` after install) was rejected as the wrong layer — `users.conf`
  is the canonical knob. The `roman-os_displaymanager` `useradd -s /bin/bash` (greeter system
  account) is intentionally left as-is; it is not the human user.
- **Paired with** the live-session half in **`roman-os-iso`** (`airootfs/etc/passwd` liveuser →
  `/bin/fish`). Decision record: `KIRO-PROJECTS/roman-os-iso/bash-to-fish-conversion.md`.

## 2026.06.24

### Propagate the chosen keyboard layout to Plasma Wayland (AZERTY fix)
- `roman-os_final` now writes `XKBLAYOUT=` (+ `XKBMODEL`/`XKBVARIANT`) into the target's
  `/etc/vconsole.conf`, mirrored from the `Option "XkbLayout"` Calamares wrote to
  `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf`. New `configure_x11_keymap()` helper, called as
  step 6, layout-agnostic (no hardcoding, no GlobalStorage threading).
- **Why:** roman-os Plasma is a **Wayland-only** edition. Calamares writes `KEYMAP=` (console) to
  `vconsole.conf` and the layout to `00-keyboard.conf`, but `systemd-localed` sources its X11
  layout from `vconsole.conf`'s `XKBLAYOUT=` — which was never written. Result: `localectl`
  reported X11 Layout `unset`, and KWin (Wayland) fell back to `us` regardless of the user's
  choice (e.g. Belgian/AZERTY came up QWERTY). Verified on a live VM.
- Runs for **all** editions (DE-agnostic) — harmless on the X11 editions (XFCE / tiling WMs),
  which already read the layout from `00-keyboard.conf`; it just keeps `localectl` consistent.
- **Paired with** `roman-os-plasma-system-settings` shipping `/etc/skel/.config/kwinrc`
  `[Wayland] FollowLocale1=true` (KWin must be told to follow `locale1`). Both halves required.

## 2026.06.21

### Add the installed user to the `i2c` group
- `users.conf` `defaultGroups` now includes `i2c`, so every account Calamares creates can access
  `/dev/i2c-*` from the first instant of the session.
- **Why:** on Plasma, `powerdevil` probes external-monitor brightness over DDC/CI (i2c) at session
  startup, *before* `systemd-logind` applies its `uaccess` ACL — losing the race and flooding the journal
  with `Open failed for /dev/i2c-1, errno=EACCES`. Group membership is present from login, so it removes
  the race and makes external-monitor brightness work immediately. Harmless on non-Plasma editions
  (XFCE/MATE/Cinnamon/tiling) — the group is simply unused there.
- The `i2c` group already exists on installed systems (created by i2c-tools/ddcutil). The live ISO is
  intentionally **not** changed — its session only runs for the ~15-minute install, so the spam there is
  irrelevant.

## 2026.06.19

### Restore the GRUB theme to /boot before grub-mkconfig
- `roman-os_before` now copies `/usr/share/grub/themes/roman-os` →
  `/boot/grub/themes/roman-os` in the target (new `install_grub_theme()` step).
- **Why:** the `roman-os-grub-theme` package installs to both `/boot/grub/themes/roman-os`
  and `/usr/share/grub/themes/roman-os`, but `mkarchiso` strips `airootfs/boot` at
  ISO-build time — so the unpacked target only has the `/usr/share` copy. With
  `GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub/themes/roman-os/theme.txt"` in `/etc/default/grub`,
  `roman-os_bootloader`'s `grub-mkconfig` wrote the theme path into `grub.cfg` but the
  files weren't there → unthemed boot menu. Restoring to `/boot` (not repointing
  `GRUB_THEME` at `/usr/share`, which would break a LUKS root) fixes it.
- Best-effort: guarded on the source dir existing; a missing theme only costs
  branding, never a bootable system. No-op on UEFI/systemd-boot (theme later
  removed by `roman-os_final`).

### Files Modified
- `usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_before/main.py`

### Remove the GRUB theme on systemd-boot installs
- `roman-os_final`'s systemd-boot cleanup (step 9) now also removes the new
  **`roman-os-grub-theme`** package and the **`update-grub`** helper, alongside
  `roman-os-bootloader-grub` and `grub`. Both depend on `grub`, so they are listed
  before it in the single `pacman -R` transaction. On BIOS/GRUB installs they
  stay (update-grub is a useful helper there).
- **Why:** on UEFI installs `roman-os_bootloader` lays down systemd-boot, so GRUB and
  its theme are dead weight. `roman-os-grub-theme` `depends=('grub')`, so it is
  removed in the same `pacman -R` transaction (dependents listed before `grub`,
  or the removal fails). Guarded by `is_package_installed`, so it is a no-op when
  the theme was never installed (BIOS installs keep GRUB + theme).

## 2026.06.13

### Trust the roman-os signing key on the installed target (production)
- `roman-os_before`'s `initialize_pacman_keys()` now runs `pacman-key --populate roman-os` after archlinux/chaotic. Without it, the re-init drops the roman-os key, leaving `nemesis_repo`/`roman-os_repo` (now `SigLevel Required` via the inherited global on prod ISOs) unverifiable → broken syncs on a fresh install. Promotes the fix proven in `roman-os-calamares-config-next` to production, paired with the `roman-os-iso` enforcement flip (same release).
- `qdd-roman-os-repo` already appends `[roman-os_repo]` with no per-repo `SigLevel` (inherits global) — no change.

### Files Modified
- `usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_before/main.py`

## 2026-06-09 — Custom roman-os_bootloader / roman-os_displaymanager / roman-os_packages modules

**What Changed**
- Replaced three stock Calamares modules with in-tree custom Python modules, wired into `settings.conf`:
  - **`roman-os_bootloader`** (`bootloader.conf` → `roman-os_bootloader.conf`) — handles both branches: systemd-boot on UEFI and `grub-install --target=i386-pc` + `grub-mkconfig` on BIOS.
  - **`roman-os_displaymanager`** (`displaymanager.conf` → `roman-os_displaymanager.conf`) — configures the display manager / default session.
  - **`roman-os_packages`** (`packages.conf` → `roman-os_packages.conf`) — install + post-install removal of installer-only packages.
- Modules ship with their own `module.desc`, schema, and test suites under `usr/lib/calamares/modules/`.

**Why**
- Owning the bootloader/displaymanager/packages logic as roman-os modules gives full control over the install sequence (e.g. the DE-agnostic session mirror and the GRUB-on-systemd-boot cleanup) rather than depending on stock module behaviour.

**Technical Details**
- Validated on production ISO **v26.06.09** across both firmware paths and both `roman-os_bootloader` branches — UEFI/systemd-boot (VM, picard, riker) and BIOS/grub (worf, `grub-install i386-pc → /dev/sda` → SUCCESS); roman-os-audit 134–139 PASS / 0 FAIL on every target. See [roman-os-iso/DISTRO_TESTING.md](../roman-os-iso/DISTRO_TESTING.md) 2026-06-09.

**Files Modified**
- `etc/calamares/settings.conf`, `etc/calamares/modules/{roman-os_bootloader,roman-os_displaymanager,roman-os_packages}.conf`
- `usr/lib/calamares/modules/{roman-os_bootloader,roman-os_displaymanager,roman-os_packages}/` (new module trees + tests)

## 2026-06-09 — Fix install-time package removal (production names, not beta)

**What Changed**
- The post-install cleanup targeted **beta** package names, so on a production install nothing
  matched and the installer tools leaked onto the user's system. Swapped to production names:
  - `roman-os_packages.conf` `try_remove`: `calamares-next` → **`calamares`**,
    `roman-os-calamares-tweak-tool-nemesis` → **`roman-os-calamares-tweak-tool`**.
  - `roman-os_final/main.py`: the systemd-boot GRUB removal `roman-os-bootloader-grub-nemesis` →
    **`roman-os-bootloader-grub`** (now matches what the 2026-06-08 entry already described); the
    self-removal of the installer config `roman-os-calamares-config-next` → **`roman-os-calamares-config`**
    (+ its warning message).

**Why**
- This repo had been copied from `roman-os-calamares-config-next` without reverting the `-next` /
  `-nemesis` suffixes, so the removal logic referenced packages that a production ISO never
  installs. Result on a real install: `calamares`, `roman-os-calamares-tweak-tool`, and
  `roman-os-calamares-config` itself all stayed installed ("install-time tool leaked to user"), plus
  GRUB was not removed on systemd-boot installs. The `-next` repo correctly keeps the beta names.

**Files Modified**
- `etc/calamares/modules/roman-os_packages.conf`
- `usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_final/main.py`

## 2026-06-08 — Promote GRUB boot-safety + spice-vdagent handling from -next

**What Changed**
- `roman-os_final`: **(a)** added `spice-vdagent` to the `qemu` VM-cleanup profile (`("qemu-guest-agent", "spice-vdagent")`); **(b)** the systemd-boot bootloader branch now removes `roman-os-bootloader-grub` **together with** `grub` in one `pacman -R` transaction (hook package first).

**Why**
- Promoting two changes validated in `roman-os-calamares-config-next` (VirtualBox BIOS, QEMU BIOS, worf bare metal, fresh KVM install). **(a)** keeps the SPICE clipboard agent on kvm/qemu installs and strips it on VMware/VirtualBox/bare-metal (same lifecycle as `qemu-guest-agent`). **(b)** `roman-os-bootloader-grub` (the new GRUB boot-safety hook package) `depends=grub`, so a plain `pacman -R grub` would fail the dependency — they must be removed in one transaction, hook package first. On grub installs both are kept.

**Files Modified**
- `usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_final/main.py` — `qemu` profile + bootloader removal branch.

**What Changed**
- `roman-os_remove_nvidia/main.py` now discovers the **actually-installed** NVIDIA driver stack and removes those real package names, instead of the hardcoded open-variant list `["nvidia-open-dkms","nvidia-utils","nvidia-settings"]`. New `installed_nvidia_stack()` (via `pacman -Qq`) + pure, testable `nvidia_stack_from_names()` matching `nvidia-*` packages ending in `dkms`/`utils`/`settings` — covers open, 390xx and 580xx. Removed `_is_installed_in_target` and the hardcoded `candidates`.

**Why**
- A 390xx (or 580xx) ISO ships `nvidia-390xx-{dkms,utils,settings}`, not `nvidia-utils`/`nvidia-settings`. The old check used `pacman -Q nvidia-utils`, which **resolves the provide** (`nvidia-390xx-utils`, exit 0) so the module thought `nvidia-utils` was installed — but `pacman -Rns nvidia-utils` does **not** resolve provides → `error: target not found` → `nvidia-remove-failed` → **install aborted on non-NVIDIA hardware**. Confirmed from a real Calamares install log. Removing the whole stack (dkms+utils+settings) in one transaction also avoids the dependency-order failure (the dkms driver depends on its `-utils`).

**Technical Details**
- `nvidia_stack_from_names()` is a pure function (no libcalamares) so the variant matching is unit-tested directly; verified it returns the right three packages for open/390xx/580xx and excludes decoys (`nvidia-prime`, `opencl-nvidia`, `lib32-nvidia-utils`).

**Files Modified**
- `usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_remove_nvidia/main.py`

### Design decision — root-on-ZFS and install-time snapshots ruled out (no config change)

**What Changed**
- Studied the CachyOS Calamares fork (`~/Documents/cachyos-calamares/`, see its `ZFS_STUDY.md`) for features roman-os might adopt. Outcome: **no config changes** — two candidate features were explicitly rejected and recorded here so they aren't re-proposed.
- **Root-on-ZFS:** declined. ZFS's real wins (RAID-Z, ARC/L2ARC caching, `send`/`receive` replication) are multi-disk/server/NAS scenarios; roman-os's single-disk desktop audience is already served by the shipped btrfs stack. ZFS is out-of-tree (CDDL), so it rides on DKMS/prebuilt modules and a bad kernel bump can leave a box unbootable — against the kernel-agnostic rule.
- **Install-time baseline snapshot** (the ArcoLinux / CachyOS `btrfs-installation-snapshot` pattern): declined. roman-os's reset story is user-driven — format-and-reinstall or take/restore a timeshift snapshot yourself. The empty `/@snapshots` subvolume in `mount.conf` is for the opt-in snapper + snap-pac + btrfs-assistant path, not for the installer to populate.

**Why**
- Everything else in the CachyOS fork is either already matched or beaten by roman-os (driver handling via `chwd` + 3 driver modes, offline microcode via `roman-os_ucode`, kernel-agnostic install via `roman-os_kernel`, firewalld instead of ufw) or conflicts with a deliberate roman-os decision (cachyos v3/v4/znver4 repos, bootloader/desktop packagechoosers). Recording the rejections keeps the lean, opinionated config from accreting showcase features that add maintenance cost without serving the typical user.

**Files Modified**
- None — decision record only.

## 2026-06-05 — LUKS2 default + firmware-correct partition table (ported from `-next`)

**What Changed**
- **`partition.conf`**: `luksGeneration: luks1 → luks2`.
- **`partition.conf`**: `defaultPartitionTableType: gpt → ""` (empty) so Calamares auto-picks **gpt on UEFI, msdos on BIOS**.

**Why**
- GRUB 2.14 (Arch `grub 2:2.14-1`, Jan 2026) added Argon2i/Argon2id KDF support, so GRUB now unlocks LUKS2/Argon2id. The old reason for forcing luks1 on GRUB machines is gone — every install can use the stronger LUKS2/Argon2id.
- The empty partition-table is a **required companion**: a hardcoded `gpt` breaks legacy-BIOS GRUB installs (`grub-install` "embedding is not possible" — GPT has no `bios_grub` partition). Empty lets Calamares give BIOS an MBR (GRUB embeds in the post-MBR gap) and UEFI a GPT+ESP.
- **Validated on real hardware before this port** (test-first rule): BIOS+grub+luks2 on *worf* and UEFI+grub+luks2 on *picard* both completed and booted — GRUB prompted for the passphrase and unlocked the LUKS2/Argon2id volume (up to ~1 GiB Argon2 memory cost). Full write-up in the nemesis CTT fork's `GRUB+LUKS2.md`.

---

## 2026-06-04 — systemd initramfs hooks (visible encrypted-boot LUKS prompt), ported from `-next`

**What Changed**
- **New `etc/calamares/modules/initcpiocfg.conf`** with `useSystemdHook: true` (+ `source: /etc/mkinitcpio.conf`).
- **`settings.conf`**: removed `roman-os_plymouth` from the exec sequence (`initcpiocfg → initcpio`).
- **Deleted the `usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_plymouth/` module** entirely — redundant with stock `initcpiocfg` *and* buggy (it inserted `plymouth` only after a `udev` hook and silently no-op'd on systemd HOOKS, the cause of the invisible/text LUKS prompt).

**Why**
- Switching to the systemd hooks (`systemd` + `sd-encrypt`) makes `sd-encrypt` ask via `systemd-ask-password`, which Plymouth's built-in password agent renders reliably as a themed prompt (the CachyOS approach). Stock `initcpiocfg` (`detect_plymouth()`) then adds the `plymouth` hook before the encrypt hook, and `bootloader` writes `rd.luks.uuid=…` + `splash`. One flag, whole chain.
- **Validated on fresh `-next` installs before this port** (per the test-first rule): encrypted (LUKS2 btrfs) renders the graphical "Enter Password" prompt; unencrypted (ext4) boots cleanly with no prompt and no failed units. The `initcpiocfg` log confirmed `which plymouth → /usr/sbin/plymouth` → `Running build hook: [plymouth]` for both kernels.
- Tradeoff: no busybox emergency recovery shell. **Switches ALL installs to the systemd initramfs** (both install types tested).

### Also ported from `-next` the same day (full config sync, minus intentional prod/next divergence)
- **`partition.conf`**: dropped the `availableFileSystemTypes: ["ext4"]` restriction → **btrfs** is now a selectable filesystem at install (default stays ext4). Encryption settings were already identical to `-next`; this is purely the btrfs enablement.
- **`mount.conf`**: added the `/.snapshots → /@snapshots` btrfs subvolume (for snapshot tooling shipped opt-in via ATT).
- **`usr/local/bin/add-roman-os-repo` + `qdd-roman-os-repo`**: idempotency bugfix — guard on an existing `[roman-os_repo]` section + `set -euo pipefail`, so re-running can't create a duplicate section (which made pacman fail with "database already registered").
- **Left intentionally divergent** (not synced): `packages.conf` (`calamares` vs `calamares-next`), `roman-os_final/main.py` (self-removes `roman-os-calamares-config` vs `…-next`), `CLAUDE.md` (repo role).
- **Open decision flagged:** `luksGeneration: luks1` is unchanged in both, but the `-next` encrypted test install produced **LUKS2** — to reconcile before the next ISO ships (LUKS2 is fine for our layout: encrypted root, unencrypted `/boot` on the ESP, systemd-boot + sd-encrypt).
- This config is **installer-only** (roman-os_repo) — it reaches no existing user; it changes only what the next production ISO offers.

## 2026-06-01 — packages: `update_db: false` so a failing `pacman -Sy` no longer aborts the install

**What Changed**
- `packages.conf`: `update_db: true` → `false`.

**Why**
- A user (roman-os-discussions #10) hit *"Package Manager error — pacman returned error code 1"* at ~99% on bare metal, on both NVIDIA boot entries. Root cause: the Calamares `packages@choice` module ran its own `pacman -Sy` on **every** install, and with `skip_if_no_internet: false` a failed `-Sy` (no internet / unreachable mirror in the live `pacman.conf`) is **fatal**, aborting near the end of the exec sequence. VMs passed only because NAT gave them internet.
- The module's only operation here is `try_remove` of the live-only packages, and `pacman -R` resolves entirely against the **local** db — it never reads the sync dbs. So the `-Sy` was a gratuitous network precondition that bought the removals nothing while introducing the late, fatal failure mode. Disabling it removes the abort with no real loss.

**Technical Details — consequence analysis**
- **Orthogonal to driver install.** `update_db: false` touches *only* the `packages` module. Driver installation happens in the separate `chwd` module (`chwd --autoconfigure` → `pacman -S`), which is the part that genuinely needs a synced sync-db — and is untouched.
- **`chwd` runs *before* `packages@choice`** in the sequence (`roman-os_before → roman-os_remove_nvidia → chwd → … → packages@choice`). So even when `packages` had `update_db: true`, that `-Sy` fired *after* chwd had already run — chwd never drew db freshness from the packages module. Its freshness has always come from `roman-os_before.sync_pacman_databases()`'s best-effort `pacman -Sy`, which still runs. The change is therefore 100% orthogonal to all three `driver=` boot lines, including `nonfreechwd`.
- **Boot line 3 (`driver=nonfreechwd`, "NVIDIA proprietary, auto-detect") is unaffected.** Online: `roman-os_before` refreshes the db before `chwd` installs the detected profile — works as before. Offline / dead-mirror: `roman-os_before`'s `-Sy` is skipped (`hasInternet=False`) or fails (caught → warn only), so chwd's `pacman -S` can't fetch — but `chwd` is **non-fatal by design** (atomic pacman transaction = nothing half-installed; its pre_remove hook cleans up its mkinitcpio drop-ins; it writes `/var/log/roman-os-chwd-skipped.log` and the install continues on nouveau/mesa). No `~99%` abort on line 3 either way.
- **Net:** the only signal `update_db: false` suppresses is the offline/dead-mirror condition, which is already treated as non-fatal upstream in `roman-os_before`. Removing the packages-module `-Sy` eliminates the abort and *reduces* coupling (the module no longer depends on db state left by earlier modules).
- **Follow-up trap to remember:** `update_db: false` is only safe while `operations:` stays removal-only. If a future `install:`/`try_install` is ever added here, it WILL need a synced db and this setting becomes dangerous — guard it at the `operations:` edit site.

**Testing**
- Needs a full **offline** install run (no network in the live session): confirm the install reaches 100% without aborting at `packages@choice`, and on the installed system `pacman -Q calamares-next mkinitcpio-archiso memtest86+ memtest86+-efi` shows all four removed.

**Files Modified**
- `etc/calamares/modules/packages.conf`

## 2026-05-31 — Three NVIDIA driver modes (free / nonfree / nonfreechwd)

**What Changed**
- `driver=` now has three modes. `roman-os_remove_nvidia` removes the baked NVIDIA packages on `free` **and** `nonfreechwd`; plain `nonfree` keeps `nvidia-open-dkms` untouched. `chwd` runs **only** on `nonfreechwd` (was: any non-`free` value).

**Why**
- `nonfree` becomes a chwd-free express lane to the baked `nvidia-open-dkms` for modern Turing+ GPUs (proven on real hardware). On `nonfreechwd`, wiping the baked driver first gives chwd a clean slate — fixes a latent conflict where chwd picking an older branch (`470xx`/`390xx`) would collide with the baked `nvidia-open-dkms`/`nvidia-utils` and fail its non-interactive pacman call.

**Technical Details**
- `roman-os_remove_nvidia/main.py`: removal condition widened to `selection in ("free", "nonfreechwd")`.
- `chwd/main.py`: gate changed from `selection == "free"` (skip) to `selection != "nonfreechwd"` (skip); docstring rewritten for the 3 modes. Module order (`roman-os_remove_nvidia` before `chwd`) makes pre-removal effective.

## 2026-05-29 — Dark installer: roman-osDark Kvantum theme (mirrored from beta)

**What Changed**

Promoted the dark Calamares installer from `roman-os-calamares-config-next` to production after a confirmed full install + reboot. The installer now renders dark (navy `#0F172A`, sky-blue `#0EA5E9` accent) matching the website, instead of the old light-grey default. The grey was caused by `-style breeze` falling back to the light default (breeze was never installed); the fix is a custom **roman-osDark** Kvantum theme launched via `-style kvantum`.

**Technical Details**

- **branding.desc** — dark sidebar (`#0F172A`/`#E2E8F0`), `SidebarTextHighlight #0EA5E9` + `SidebarSelect #FFFFFF`, `productIcon` + `productWelcome` → `welcome.png` (dark-navy K).
- **stylesheet.qss** — accent `#58B2D7` → `#0284C7`, nav-button `:hover` text → white, selections → white on `#0284C7`, dark scrollbar track.
- **show.qml** — the dark text slideshow (brand slides + slate gradient backdrop that blends with roman-osDark).
- **welcome.png** — new dark-navy K (blends into the panel, no white box).
- **roman-os_final** — now removes `root/.config/Kvantum` from the target (roman-osDark styles the installer-as-root but is live-only cruft on the installed system; verified gone post-install).
- Paired: `roman-os-iso` ships the roman-osDark theme + `kvantum`; the production `calamares` package launcher drops `calamares-wrapper` and uses `-style kvantum`.

## 2026-05-29 — `roman-os_plymouth` module: roman-os boot splash built into every kernel's initramfs

**What Changed**

New Calamares job module `roman-os_plymouth` adds the `plymouth` hook to the target's `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`, so the roman-os boot splash (`plymouth-theme-roman-os-logo`, shipped on the ISO) is built into the initramfs of **every** kernel the user selected — automatically, with no per-kernel work. It runs between `initcpiocfg` (which writes the HOOKS line) and `initcpio` (which runs `mkinitcpio -P` for all presets), inserting `plymouth` right after `udev` and leaving every other hook `initcpiocfg` decided untouched.

Rationale: `initcpiocfg` recomputes HOOKS from the partition layout and never adds plymouth, so the hook had to be injected after it but before the single `mkinitcpio -P`. The splash is kernel-agnostic — that one rebuild embeds it into each preset, and any kernel installed later picks it up via pacman's own `mkinitcpio` run against the same conf. The `splash` cmdline param is already auto-appended by the `bootloader` module when plymouth is present, and the default theme is set at ISO-build time by the package's `.install`, so this module is the only missing piece.

**Technical Details**

- [usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_plymouth/main.py](usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_plymouth/main.py) — `add_hook()` inserts `plymouth` after `udev` via a `\budev\b` word-anchored regex (count=1), idempotent (no-op if `plymouth` already in HOOKS). Guarded by `plymouth_installed()` (checks `usr/bin/plymouth` in the target) so it never adds a hook that `mkinitcpio` can't satisfy. `module.desc` mirrors `roman-os_kernel` (python job, `noconfig: true`).
- [etc/calamares/settings.conf](etc/calamares/settings.conf) — `roman-os_plymouth` added to the `exec` sequence between `initcpiocfg` and `initcpio`.
- Mirrored verbatim into the `roman-os-calamares-config-next` tree (module + sequence) per the lockstep convention.

**Files Modified**
- `usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_plymouth/main.py` (new)
- `usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_plymouth/module.desc` (new)
- `etc/calamares/settings.conf`

## 2026-05-29 — `[cachyos]` repo disabled by default on the installed system

**What Changed**

`roman-os_final` now comments out the `[cachyos]` repo (header + its `Include` line) in the target `/etc/pacman.conf` at the end of the install. cachyos stays **enabled during** the install — chwd pulls its driver packages from it — and is only disabled afterward, so nothing about driver selection changes. The keyring and mirrorlist remain installed; a user re-enables cachyos by uncommenting the two lines.

Rationale: keeps `pacman -Syu` from silently swapping base packages for cachyos-optimized rebuilds, leaving the installed system closer to stock Arch with cachyos as opt-in. Safe for the **default kernel** because `chaotic-aur` stays enabled and carries `linux-cachyos`/`-headers`, so updates keep flowing. (If `chaotic-aur` is ever dropped, this must be revisited — cachyos would become the sole source for `linux-cachyos`.)

**Technical Details**

- [usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_final/main.py](usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_final/main.py) — new private `_disable_repo(target_root, repo)` helper comments a repo section (header + body lines until a blank line or next `[section]`); idempotent. Called for `cachyos` from `run()`, after the tuned pin and before bootloader config. Placement is well after chwd in the exec sequence, so drivers install before the repo is disabled.
- chwd skip-marker text ([chwd/main.py](usr/lib/calamares/modules/chwd/main.py)) updated: the retry hint now tells the user to uncomment `[cachyos]` if a driver package can't be found.
- Verified post-install by `roman-os-audit`'s `check_pacman_repos` ([edu-system-files](/home/erik/EDU/edu-system-files/CHANGELOG.md)): PASS when cachyos is commented, soft WARN if re-enabled or absent.

## 2026-05-29 — chwd failure is now non-fatal (install no longer aborts)

**What Changed**

On a laptop install, `chwd --autoconfigure` selected a driver profile whose package set included a package that none of the configured target repos carried. pacman aborted the transaction, the chwd module returned a `(error_title, error_description)` tuple, and Calamares **aborted the whole installation** — leaving the user with no installed system over a missing driver package.

The chwd module now treats a chwd failure as **non-fatal**. When `chwd --autoconfigure` exits non-zero, the module logs a `libcalamares.utils.warning`, writes a breadcrumb to `/var/log/roman-os-chwd-skipped.log` on the target, and returns `None` so the install completes on the open driver (nouveau/mesa, already in the ISO). This is safe because pacman transactions are atomic (a missing target installs nothing) and chwd's own `pre_remove` hook removes any mkinitcpio drop-ins it had written, so a failed run leaves no half-configured state.

**Technical Details**

- [usr/lib/calamares/modules/chwd/main.py](usr/lib/calamares/modules/chwd/main.py) — `run()` no longer returns the error tuple from `run_in_host`; on failure it warns, calls the new private `_record_skip(root_mount_point, detail)` helper, sets progress to 1.0, and returns `None`.
- `_record_skip` writes `/var/log/roman-os-chwd-skipped.log` (reason + retry hint) into the chroot; an `OSError` while writing is itself non-fatal (warn only).
- Considered a true pre-flight `pacman -Sp` dry-run (the original ask) but chose best-effort: identical end state (drivers if available, else open driver + install intact), ~5 lines, and zero coupling to chwd internals so it survives chwd upstream changes.
- The skip is **not silent**: `roman-os-audit`'s new `check_chwd` ([edu-system-files](/home/erik/EDU/edu-system-files/CHANGELOG.md)) surfaces the marker as a WARN on the installed system.

## 2026-05-28 — Hardware-aware install via **chwd** (synced from `roman-os-calamares-config-next`)

The chwd Calamares module developed and validated in [roman-os-calamares-config-next](../roman-os-calamares-config-next/) on this same date is now mirrored here. Validated end-to-end on a VirtualBox install: module loaded correctly, read `driver=nonfree` from `/proc/cmdline`, invoked `arch-chroot $rootMountPoint chwd --autoconfigure` inside the target chroot, returned cleanly. All 42 Calamares jobs completed; install booted successfully. The companion package [chwd in nemesis_repo](../../EDU-PKG-BUILD/edu-pkgbuild-3party/chwd/) ships a patched profiles.toml fixing the upstream CachyOS `[virtualbox]` / `[vmware]` vendor_id swap, so VirtualBox guests now match the correct profile and install `virtualbox-guest-utils` via chwd's `--autoconfigure` path.

### Changes synced

**New module: `usr/lib/calamares/modules/chwd/`**

Two-file Python jobmodule modelled after CachyOS's own `cachyos-calamares/src/modules/chwd/`. `module.desc` declares a Python `job` module pointing at `main.py`. `main.py` runs `arch-chroot $rootMountPoint chwd --autoconfigure` inside the target chroot — chwd then inspects PCI/USB devices, matches them against priority-ranked TOML profiles in `/var/lib/chwd/db/`, and installs the right driver bundle (NVIDIA 470xx / 580xx / nvidia-open-dkms / nouveau / AMD / Intel / Broadcom / hybrid PRIME variants for laptops via DMI chassis types 8/9/10/11). The module honours the existing GRUB-menu `driver=` kernel cmdline: on `driver=free` it skips itself entirely so `roman-os_remove_nvidia` keeps owning that path; on `driver=nonfree` chwd does the smart hardware-detection install.

**Settings.conf — chwd added to exec sequence**

[etc/calamares/settings.conf](etc/calamares/settings.conf) — `chwd` inserted between `roman-os_remove_nvidia` and `initcpiocfg`. Position matters: DKMS modules that chwd installs need to be present before `initcpiocfg` writes the mkinitcpio preset and `initcpio` regenerates the initramfs.

### Why keep `roman-os_remove_nvidia`

The two modules are complementary, not overlapping: `roman-os_remove_nvidia` is the fast path for `driver=free` (removes baked-in `nvidia-open-dkms` for a pure nouveau install); chwd is the smart path for `driver=nonfree` (looks at the actual GPU and picks the right proprietary variant). Folding them into one is a future cleanup once chwd is fully trusted across hardware variants.

### Pairs With

- [roman-os-iso](../roman-os-iso/) — needs the same package-list updates as `roman-os-iso-next` got: add `chwd`, `b43-fwcutter`, `broadcom-wl-dkms`, `hwdetect` to `archiso/packages.x86_64`. Without these the live ISO has no chwd to run.
- [edu-pkgbuild-3party/chwd](../../EDU-PKG-BUILD/edu-pkgbuild-3party/chwd/) — the patched chwd PKGBUILD in nemesis_repo. Self-validating sed in `prepare()` fixes upstream's swapped vendor_ids for the `[virtualbox]` and `[vmware]` graphic_drivers profiles.

**Files modified**
- `usr/lib/calamares/modules/chwd/module.desc` (new)
- `usr/lib/calamares/modules/chwd/main.py` (new)
- `etc/calamares/settings.conf` — `chwd` inserted between `roman-os_remove_nvidia` and `initcpiocfg`

## 2026-05-28 — roman-os_final pins tuned ppd_base_profile = performance

**Symptom:** Both bare-metal pre-release installs (Picard + Riker, v26.05.28) reported `tuned-adm active = balanced` instead of `throughput-performance`. `/etc/tuned/ppd_base_profile` contained `balanced` and was owned by `tuned 2.27.0-1` per `pacman -Qo`.

**Root cause:** The earlier "fix" assumed `/etc/tuned/ppd_base_profile` was "intentionally absent" so that ppd.conf's `default=performance` fallback would win. That assumption was wrong — the upstream `tuned` package's pacman install writes the file fresh during Calamares' package phase, with content `balanced`. The fall-through to `default=performance` therefore never fires.

**Fix:** New step in `roman-os_final/main.py` (between "Configure Bluetooth and PulseAudio" and "Configure bootloader" — last module, so it runs after every package install and overlay write): open `<target>/etc/tuned/ppd_base_profile` and write `performance\n`. Logged as `Pin tuned ppd_base_profile: SUCCESS` in the module result summary. Tradeoff: unconditional overwrite — a user who has manually changed the file and then reinstalls will lose their setting, which is the correct behavior on a fresh install.

Paired with a new `check_tuned_profile` in [edu-system-files/usr/local/bin/roman-os-audit](/home/erik/EDU/edu-system-files/usr/local/bin/roman-os-audit) that asserts the pinned value + `tuned-adm active == throughput-performance` post-install, so the regression is caught by audit on every future install instead of via syscheck spelunk.

## 2026-05-28 — multi-kernel install: cmdline-duplication fix + mkinitcpio churn cut

Two install-time fixes surfaced by the first multi-kernel install (cachyos + zen, see [roman-os-iso/DISTRO_TESTING.md](/home/erik/KIRO/roman-os-iso/DISTRO_TESTING.md)).

### Bug fix — duplicated `rw root=UUID=…` in second kernel's boot-loader entry

**Symptom:** On a 2-kernel install, the first kernel's `/boot/efi/loader/entries/*.conf` had a clean `options` line; the second kernel's entry had `rw root=UUID=…` appearing **twice**. Root cause traced to `/etc/kernel/cmdline` itself being written with the duplicates — so any subsequent kernel install (`pacman -U linux-foo`) on the user's system would also inherit them.

**Root cause:** [bootloader/main.py:133-148](etc/calamares/pkgbuild/modules/bootloader/main.py) — `get_kernel_params(uuid)` did:

```python
kernel_params = libcalamares.job.configuration.get("kernelParams", ["quiet"])
```

`libcalamares.job.configuration.get()` returns a **reference** to the config-stored list, not a copy. Every subsequent `.append("rw")` / `.append("root=UUID=…")` / `.extend(…)` mutated that shared, config-backed list. When `get_kernel_params()` is called more than once per install — which happens because `create_systemd_boot_conf()` is invoked once per installed kernel — the second call starts from the already-mutated list and re-appends, producing the duplicates.

`quiet nowatchdog` come from config and never duplicate (they're already in the list before any `.append`); only the runtime-appended `rw` + `root=UUID=` show the doubling. That signature confirmed the diagnosis precisely.

**Fix:** defensive copy via `list(…)` wrapper. One line:

```python
kernel_params = list(libcalamares.job.configuration.get("kernelParams", ["quiet"]))
```

Now every call starts from a fresh local list; the config-stored value is never mutated. Long comment block left in the code explaining why — the bug is the kind that takes hours to re-diagnose if it ever regresses.

### Performance — collapsed mkinitcpio passes from 5 → 1 during install

**Observation:** A 2-kernel install ran `==> Building image from preset` **5 times** (10 image builds total) during a ~4-minute Calamares run — `~30-60s of pure churn`. Root cause: every package operation in the install pipeline triggers the upstream `/usr/share/libalpm/hooks/90-mkinitcpio-install.hook`, which rebuilds initramfs for every installed kernel. Triggering events seen 2026-05-28:

1. `nvidia-*` DKMS removal in `roman-os_remove_nvidia` (modules dir change)
2. The official Calamares `initcpiocfg` + `Creating initramfs with mkinitcpio…` job (job 23-24 of 41)
3. `pacman -Rs --noconfirm mkinitcpio-archiso` in the packages module (initcpio files dir change)
4. Microcode reinstall in `roman-os_ucode`
5. Second pass after another microcode-related action

Only **#2** is needed — it's the explicit Calamares job that invokes `mkinitcpio -P` directly (not via the hook) with the final `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`. The other four are hook-triggered duplicates of the same work.

**Fix:** standard `etc/pacman.d/hooks/<hookname>` override pattern:

- **`roman-os_before`** (job 21/41, early): new `suppress_mkinitcpio_hook()` step that symlinks `<target>/etc/pacman.d/hooks/90-mkinitcpio-install.hook` → `/dev/null`. Pacman's hook-resolver prefers `/etc/pacman.d/hooks/` over `/usr/share/libalpm/hooks/`, so a `/dev/null` override silently nullifies the upstream hook. Best-effort: a failure here only loses the optimisation, doesn't break the install.

- **`roman-os_final`** (job 39/41, end): new restore block at the very end of `run()`, after every package operation in this module. Removes the symlink so the user's first `pacman -Syu` rebuilds initramfs normally on kernel upgrades. **MUST run** — a stuck `/dev/null` symlink would leave the user's system unable to refresh initramfs after any future kernel package change. Wrapped in its own try/except so an earlier roman-os_final failure can't skip it.

The explicit Calamares mkinitcpio job at step 23-24 still runs because it invokes mkinitcpio directly, not via the pacman hook — so the source-of-truth initramfs pass is preserved. Estimated save: ~30-60s on a 2-kernel install (5 hook-triggered passes × 2 kernels = 10 image builds → 1 pass × 2 kernels = 2 image builds).

### Performance — extended hook suppression to 6 more cache-rebuild hooks

Same pattern as the mkinitcpio fix above, generalised to the other heavyweight cache-rebuild pacman hooks that fire per transaction during install. With 4+ pacman transactions in the pipeline (`roman-os_remove_nvidia`, `packages`, `roman-os_ucode`, `roman-os_final` removals) each one re-runs the same expensive chain from scratch.

Hooks now shadowed to `/dev/null` in the chroot (in addition to `90-mkinitcpio-install.hook`):

- `gtk-update-icon-cache.hook` — icon theme caches
- `update-desktop-database.hook` — `.desktop` MIME cache
- `30-update-mime-database.hook` — shared MIME database
- `fontconfig.hook` — `fc-cache`
- `dconf-update.hook` — system dconf databases
- `xorg-mkfontscale.hook` — X font dir indices

**`roman-os_before/main.py`** — `suppress_mkinitcpio_hook()` renamed to `suppress_pacman_hooks()` and now iterates a module-level `SUPPRESSED_HOOKS` tuple. Same `/dev/null` shadow-symlink trick under `/etc/pacman.d/hooks/`.

**`roman-os_final/main.py`** — old single-hook restore replaced with two helpers: `restore_suppressed_hooks()` (loops over the same tuple, unlinks each shadow symlink) and `rebuild_caches_once()` (runs each hook's underlying command exactly ONCE in the chroot via a `CACHE_REBUILD_STEPS` table). Without the one-shot rebuild the installed system would boot with stale caches (missing icons, unknown MIME types, blank font lists, no dconf defaults). The mkinitcpio hook has no entry in the rebuild table — Calamares' explicit `initcpio` job already rebuilt initramfs before roman-os_final runs.

Realistic save: 15-30s on top of the existing mkinitcpio fix. VM-install benchmark vs the post-mkinitcpio-fix baseline still pending.

### Performance — guard `roman-os_ucode.remove_ucode_package()` with a pre-existence check

[roman-os_ucode/main.py](usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_ucode/main.py): the "wrong microcode" removal previously called `pacman -R --noconfirm <pkg>` unconditionally and caught the failure when the package wasn't there. Added a `pacman -Q` guard via a new `is_installed_in_target()` method mirroring the `roman-os_remove_nvidia._is_installed_in_target()` pattern. When the wrong-vendor microcode isn't installed (the normal case — the live ISO ships microcode as bundled `.pkg.tar.zst` rather than as installed packages) we now skip the `pacman -R` call entirely.

Save: small (~2-3s per install), but free. Counterpart fix for `roman-os_remove_nvidia` was unnecessary — that module already had `_is_installed_in_target()` guarding the candidate list.

### Performance — mtime-gated cache rebuilds + VM-skip for roman-os_ucode

Follow-up to the earlier "extended hook suppression" change. The first measurement showed install was actually ~6 s **slower** with all 6 cache rebuilds running unconditionally in `roman-os_final` (`update-mime-database` alone cost ~8 s, fc-cache ~2 s, while the corresponding hooks would only have fired for transactions that touch their trigger paths — which the roman-os install pipeline mostly doesn't). Two changes to recover that time without giving up the first-boot freshness guarantee:

**`roman-os_before/main.py`** — new `snapshot_cache_trigger_mtimes()` step that records the pristine mtime of every cache trigger dir (`usr/share/icons`, `usr/share/applications`, `usr/share/mime/packages`, `usr/share/fonts`, `etc/dconf/db`) into `libcalamares.globalstorage` under key `roman-osCacheMtimeBaseline`. Runs after the lock wait and before any pacman op, so we capture the post-unpackfs state.

**`roman-os_final/main.py`** — `CACHE_REBUILD_STEPS` now carries the trigger dir alongside the description and command. New `_cache_trigger_changed()` helper compares current mtime against the baseline; `rebuild_caches_once()` skips any step whose trigger dir mtime is unchanged. Defensive default: when the baseline is missing or the dir can't be stat'd, we rebuild (favour correctness over speed). Limit: only the top-level dir's own mtime is checked, not files inside its subdirs — that matches pacman's hook trigger semantics without an expensive recursive walk.

**`roman-os_ucode/main.py`** — added `_detect_target_virt()` and an early-return at the top of `run()` when `systemd-detect-virt` in the target chroot reports anything other than `none`. The hypervisor handles guest microcode, so the `pacman -U <vendor>-ucode` + `pacman -R <other-vendor>-ucode` work is pure waste on a VM (~5 s per install). Bare metal is untouched. Both ucode packages stay installed in their live-ISO state; the kernel ignores them on a guest CPU. Counterpart of `roman-os_final`'s existing `VM_CLEANUP_BY_TYPE` logic.

Expected combined save vs the previous build: ~10-12 s on VM installs (skip roman-os_ucode + skip mime/font/dconf/mkfontscale rebuilds when triggers untouched); ~5-10 s on bare metal.

### Ruff cleanups (incidental, in the same file)

[bootloader/main.py](etc/calamares/pkgbuild/modules/bootloader/main.py): four pre-existing lint hits in upstream-derived code, fixed while in the file:

- L659: `not (x in y)` → `x not in y` (E713)
- L858 (refind branch): removed unused `install_efi_directory = …` assignment (F841)
- L896: stripped unnecessary `f""` prefix (F541)
- L949: `install_hybrid_grub == True` → `install_hybrid_grub` (E712)

### Files modified

- `etc/calamares/pkgbuild/modules/bootloader/main.py` (cmdline defensive copy + 4 ruff fixes)
- `usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_before/main.py` (`suppress_mkinitcpio_hook` + register)
- `usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_final/main.py` (restore block at end of `run()`)

### Follow-ups

- Mirror to `roman-os-calamares-config-next` once verified.
- Verification path: rebuild `roman-os-calamares-config-git`, rebuild ISO, re-test VM install, then bare metal — confirm zen entry's cmdline is single-`rw`-single-`root=UUID=` AND grep `==> Building image` in Calamares.log returns 2 lines (one per kernel) instead of 10.

## 2026-05-27 — roman-os_final: remove the live-only desktop-launcher trust helper

`roman-os_final` now removes **`/usr/local/bin/roman-os-trust-desktop-launchers`** from the installed system. That helper is a new live-ISO autostart (added in `roman-os-iso`) that pre-trusts the **Install roman-os** desktop launcher so XFCE/Thunar doesn't prompt — useful only on the live session, so it's added to the `paths_to_remove` list. Its autostart entry under `/home/liveuser/.config/autostart/` needs no explicit cleanup: `removeuser` deletes the live user's home earlier in the sequence, so listing it could even error depending on timing.

## 2026-05-27 — kernel-agnostic installer (new `roman-os_kernel` module)

### What Changed

- **New `roman-os_kernel` module makes the installer independent of the ISO's kernel package.** Previously three places hardcoded `linux-lqx`: the `unpackfs@vmlinuz` job (copied `vmlinuz-linux-lqx` from the live medium), `roman-os_before`'s preset rename (`roman-os` → `linux-lqx.preset`), and the static `roman-os` preset. `roman-os_kernel` now **loops over every** `vmlinuz-*` on the live medium (`/run/archiso/bootmnt/arch/boot/x86_64/`), copying each image to `/boot/vmlinuz-<kernel>`, generating a matching `/etc/mkinitcpio.d/<kernel>.preset`, and removing the live-only preset artifacts (`roman-os`, `linux.preset`) **first** so the plain `linux` kernel's preset isn't clobbered. So an ISO built with any kernel — or several — installs correctly with **zero edits to the calamares config**.
- **`unpackfs@vmlinuz` removed**, replaced by `roman-os_kernel` in the exec sequence (same slot, after `unpackfs@rootfs`); the `vmlinuz` unpackfs instance and `unpackfs2.conf` deleted.
- **`roman-os_before` no longer renames the preset** — `move_mkinitcpio_preset()` and its step removed; preset handling lives entirely in `roman-os_kernel`. Stores `roman-osKernels` (list) + `roman-osKernel` (primary) in globalstorage.

### Technical Details

- Developed and validated on `roman-os-calamares-config-next` first, then mirrored here byte-for-byte (the kernel-touched files diff identical to the proven `-next` versions). **Proven end-to-end on real installs:** CachyOS (single kernel) and `linux-lts` + `linux-zen` (multi-kernel) both installed and booted, with all kernels' images, initramfs, and intact headers present. Paired with `roman-os-iso`'s build-side kernel selector.
- `initcpio.conf` runs `mkinitcpio -P` (all presets), so each generated `<kernel>.preset` yields one initramfs; `roman-os_final`'s `linux.preset` removal is left as a guarded no-op.

## 2026-05-26 — cups printing + logrotate.timer enabled on installed system

### What Changed

- **`services-systemd` now enables `cups.socket`.** Printing was off after a fresh install + reboot. The live ISO enabled CUPS via airootfs symlinks, but those are not carried into the installed system, and the Calamares `services-systemd` unit list (ananicy-cpp, tuned, tuned-ppd, firewalld) never enabled cups. Added a `cups.socket` → `enable` → `mandatory: true` entry. Socket activation only — `cups.service` starts on demand when a client opens the print socket, so there is no always-running daemon. Paired with `roman-os-iso`, which trims its airootfs cups symlinks to socket-only.
- **`services-systemd` now enables `logrotate.timer`.** On a fresh install the timer was active-but-not-enabled (`is-enabled` = disabled), so its persistence wasn't guaranteed. Enabling it explicitly caps unbounded growth of file-based logs (`pacman.log`, Xorg/app logs); journald rotates its own store separately via `SystemMaxUse`. Set `mandatory: false` so a log-rotation timer can never abort an install. `man-db.timer` was reviewed alongside and **declined** (only refreshes the apropos index; periodic SSD/laptop wakeup churn for marginal benefit). Mirrored to `roman-os-calamares-config-next`.

### Files Modified

- [etc/calamares/modules/services-systemd.conf](etc/calamares/modules/services-systemd.conf)

## 2026-05-26 — README: community framing, dropped "personal"

### What Changed

- **README no longer calls roman-os "my personal choice".** The defaults list (systemboot, ext4, sddm, xfce4 and chadwm, free software) is now introduced as "roman-os ships with opinionated defaults so it works out of the box" — community framing instead of the early single-user wording. Rule codified in [roman-os-HQ/ASSISTANT.md](../../Insync/roman-os/roman-os-HQ/ASSISTANT.md). README only; no installer behaviour changed, no rebuild needed.

## 2026-05-25 — roman-os_final: remove live-only do-not-suspend.conf

### What Changed

- **`roman-os_final` now removes `/etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/do-not-suspend.conf` on the installed system.** This drop-in (`HandleSuspendKey` / `HandleHibernateKey` / `HandleLidSwitch=ignore`) ships in the airootfs overlay so the live ISO does not suspend mid-install, but it was never cleaned up afterward — it persisted on every installed system and silently disabled suspend / hibernate / lid handling for end users (notably on laptops). Added it to the `paths_to_remove` list alongside the other live-only artifacts.

### Technical Details

- One-line addition to `paths_to_remove` in `roman-os_final/main.py`, grouped with the existing live-only cleanups (getty autologin, `linux.preset`, `10-archiso.conf`); reuses the existing `remove_path()` helper, so no change to the removal loop.
- Caught by `roman-os-check` on an installed roman-os system. `roman-os-audit` has no check for this file, so the leak had been passing the audit clean.

### Files Modified

- `usr/lib/calamares/modules/roman-os_final/main.py`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

## 2026-05-24 — PKGBUILD Promotion, Swap Options, Repo Sync

### What Changed

- **PKGBUILD identity flipped to canonical** — the package now `provides=('calamares')` and `conflicts=('calamares-next' 'calamares-git')`, the reverse of the previous `provides=('calamares-next')` / `conflicts=('calamares' 'calamares-git')`. This config repo's build is now the production `calamares` package, with the `-next` repo holding the beta. `pkgver` placeholder bumped `3.3.14.r132` → `3.4.2.r4`, `pkgrel` `3` → `1`, and the `calamares-wrapper` sha256 refreshed.
- **partition.conf swap choices expanded** — re-enabled the previously commented-out `small` (up to 4GB) and `suspend` (≥ RAM size) options. `userSwapChoices` now offers `none / small / suspend / file`; `suspend` enables hibernation.
- **cal-roman-os.desktop rebranded** — `Name`/`Comment` changed from "Install ArcoLinux" / "Installer for ArcoLinux" to "Install roman-os" / "Installer for roman-os". The live-desktop copy is now installed executable (`-Dm755` + explicit `chmod +x`) so it launches without the "untrusted desktop file" prompt.
- **amd-ucode bundle updated** `20260410-1` → `20260519-1` (`.pkg.tar.zst` + `.sig` swapped).
- **`calamares-widget-tree` branding file removed** (572 lines) — stale/unused.

### Technical Details

- **`up.sh` gained two sync functions.** `update_ucode()` refreshes the bundled microcode packages; `update_pkgbuild()` copies the latest hand-built PKGBUILD folder from `~/KIRO-PKG-BUILD` into `etc/calamares/pkgbuild/`. The sync only considers `calamares-3*` folders (skipping the `calamares-next-*` beta folders that belong to the `-next` config repo), picks the highest version via `sort -V`, and **strips** `up.sh`, `setup.sh`, `.current-version`, `.previous-version` from the destination after the copy — those belong to `KIRO-PKG-BUILD`, not this repo. Stripping is unconditional so it also clears remnants from earlier syncs.
- A `build.sh` helper was added under `etc/calamares/pkgbuild/`. **Remember:** the PKGBUILD and its build helpers are authored in `~/KIRO/roman-os-pkgbuild/` (now synced via `~/KIRO-PKG-BUILD`) — do not hand-edit them here.

## 2026-05-22 — VM Cleanup Correctness, tuned, pacman -Sy, gpt default

### Bare-metal VM cleanup was silently skipped (roman-os_final)

`systemd-detect-virt` **exits 1 on bare metal** while still printing `none` to stdout. The previous `subprocess.run(check=True)` raised `CalledProcessError`, the handler returned `"unknown"`, and all three VM-cleanup branches were skipped — so `open-vm-tools`, `qemu-guest-agent`, and `virtualbox-guest-utils` (plus their orphan service symlinks) shipped through to installed bare-metal systems.

- Dropped `check=True` so stdout is captured regardless of exit code; empty output falls back to `"unknown"`.
- Refactored the three nested `if vm_type in [...]` blocks into a declarative `VM_CLEANUP_PROFILES` + `VM_CLEANUP_BY_TYPE` table dispatched through a single `cleanup_vm_profile()` helper. Behaviour preserved for all existing `vm_type` values; `none` (bare metal) strips all three profiles.
- Orphan `multi-user.target.wants/` symlinks (`vmtoolsd`, `vmware-vmblock-fuse`, `qemu-guest-agent`, `vboxservice`) are now unlinked **unconditionally** per profile — `pacman -Rns` removes the unit file but not the enable-time symlink, and `systemctl disable` inside the chroot is unreliable without a running dbus.

### tuned enabled on install (services-systemd.conf)

Added `tuned.service` and `tuned-ppd.service` (both `mandatory: true`) to `services-systemd`. The roman-os-iso airootfs enables them and pins `throughput-performance`, but Calamares does not preserve the airootfs `.wants/` symlinks across install — packages landed but services came up disabled, so installed systems fell back to tuned's `balanced` default. `/etc/tuned/active_profile` already copies through `unpackfs`, so enabling the service restores the intended profile.

### pacman sync DBs refreshed (roman-os_before)

Added a `sync_pacman_databases()` step (after key init, before any later pacman use) running `pacman -Sy --noconfirm` in the chroot. Without it the ISO's bundled `/var/lib/pacman/sync/` is empty/stale, and `roman-os_remove_nvidia` / `roman-os_ucode` / `roman-os_final` emitted ~20 `database file for 'core' does not exist (use '-Sy')` warnings. Best-effort: a flaky mirror is logged and swallowed. Gated on Calamares' `hasInternet` globalstorage flag — explicit `False` skips cleanly instead of waiting on a pacman timeout; unset/unknown still attempts.

### gpt as default partition table (partition.conf)

Set `defaultPartitionTableType: gpt` to silence the install-time "setting is unset, will use gpt/msdos" warning. Matches roman-os's EFI-first stance; BIOS installs still get the correct table per medium.

### Silenced "No config file" warnings (roman-os_* module.desc)

Added `noconfig: true` to all four custom modules' `module.desc` and removed four misplaced dummy `.conf` files that had been dropped inside the module code directories. Calamares only searches `/etc/calamares/modules/` and `/usr/share/calamares/modules/` for configs — never the module's own code dir — so those dummies were invisible and the warnings kept firing. None of the four modules read module-level config (they use only `globalstorage` + `utils`), and Calamares supports `noconfig: true` ([Descriptor.cpp:96](https://codeberg.org/erikdubois/calamares/src/branch/master/src/libcalamares/modulesystem/Descriptor.cpp#L96) / [ModuleManager.cpp:165](https://codeberg.org/erikdubois/calamares/src/branch/master/src/libcalamaresui/modulesystem/ModuleManager.cpp#L165)) for exactly this case. If a module ever grows real config, flip the flag off and ship a real `<module>.conf` under `etc/calamares/modules/`.

## 2026-05-19 — Liquorix Kernel Promoted to Production

### Kernel Switch: linux → linux-lqx

The Liquorix kernel (`linux-lqx`) has been validated in `roman-os-calamares-config-next` and is now the default kernel for production roman-os installs.

**`unpackfs2.conf`** — source path updated from `vmlinuz-linux` to `vmlinuz-linux-lqx`, and destination from `/boot/vmlinuz-linux` to `/boot/vmlinuz-linux-lqx`. This is the step that copies the kernel into the installed target.

**`roman-os_before/main.py`** — preset rename now targets `linux-lqx.preset` instead of `linux.preset`. The installed mkinitcpio preset must match the kernel package name.

**`roman-os_final/main.py`** — two changes:

- Added `etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux.preset` to the live-only artifact cleanup list. The archiso live environment ships a `linux.preset`; with `linux-lqx` as the installed kernel, the correct preset (`linux-lqx.preset`) comes from the kernel package and `linux.preset` is a stale artifact that should not persist into the installed system.
- Self-removal step confirmed to remove `roman-os-calamares-config` (the production package name).

**`roman-os_ucode/main.py`** — gained a `remove_ucode_package()` method that cleans up the non-matching microcode package after installing the correct one. For example, on an Intel machine it installs `intel-ucode` and removes `amd-ucode`, and vice versa. Previously only the correct package was installed; the wrong one could linger.

**`displaymanager.conf`** — trailing newline normalised (cosmetic only).

---

## 2026-04-26
- **`amd-ucode`** package updated → `20260410-1`
